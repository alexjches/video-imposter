# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

Two things that must not be confused:

- **The spec** — `docs/BUILD-PLAN.md` ("Video Imposter — Build Plan", 21 sections). This is the **authoritative target**. Its Section 20 is a confirmed-decisions log; treat those values as binding, not suggestions.
- **The code in `src/`** — an early, partial sketch of the functional plumbing. Per spec Section 21, it is **missing most of the spec** and its **visual design should be ignored entirely**. Do not treat the current feature set as the goal.

**The visual target is `vhs-frontend-example/`**, not `src/`. Spec §21 is explicit: where `vhs-frontend-example` and the general style direction in §18 conflict on a visual detail, `vhs-frontend-example` wins. The current Tailwind theme and `src/app/globals.css` component classes are *not* the design to build toward.

When a request is ambiguous, the spec decides. When the spec and the code disagree, the code is what's wrong — see the divergence table below.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push   # required before first run (creates prisma/dev.db)
npm run dev                                 # tsx server.js — Next.js + Socket.io on :3000
npm run build                               # next build
npm run lint                                # next lint
node vhs-frontend-example/server.js         # visual reference, static, :9000
```

- **Never start the app with `next dev`.** Socket.io is attached to a custom HTTP server in `server.js`; the plain Next dev server has no websocket layer and every room/game feature silently breaks.
- `npm start` is written as `NODE_ENV=production tsx server.js` (POSIX syntax). On this Windows machine that fails in PowerShell — use the Bash tool, or `$env:NODE_ENV='production'; npx tsx server.js`.
- No test framework is configured. Verification is `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, and `npx next build`.
- **Game logic is best verified by scripting socket clients**, not by clicking through four browser windows. Boot the server, then drive `socket.io-client` through a full round (create → join ×3 → start → syncReady → videoEnded → readyToAdvance → word ×N → vote → results) asserting on the payloads. A round takes seconds and catches phase-machine regressions that manual play misses. Run such a script from outside the repo with `NODE_PATH=<repo>/node_modules`.

## Current architecture

Next.js 14 App Router frontend + a Socket.io game server in the same process. `server.js` (CommonJS) boots Next, creates the socket.io `Server`, and calls `registerSocketHandlers(io)` from `src/server/socketHandlers.ts` — `tsx` is what lets a `.js` entrypoint `require` that TS module.

Note the stack already diverges from spec §15, which recommended React+Vite / Supabase / LiveKit. The existing Next.js + Prisma + custom-socket-server choice is what's actually built; don't rewrite it wholesale without asking.

**Two separate stores, deliberately:**
- **Game state is in-memory only** — a `Map<code, RoomState>` in `src/server/gameState.ts`. Restarting the dev server destroys every active room. Player identity *is* `socket.id`, so a refresh or reconnect creates a brand-new player; there is no rejoin path. This blocks several spec features (persistent currency, host transfer across reconnects) and will need to change.
- **Prisma/SQLite holds only durable, non-game data** — users, NextAuth accounts/sessions, video presets. The `GameHistory` model exists in the schema but nothing reads or writes it.

**The core secrecy invariant.** The game rests on players not knowing their role. `sanitizeRoom()` in `socketHandlers.ts` strips `normalVideoUrl`/`imposterVideoUrl` from every room broadcast, exposing only `hasNormalVideo`/`hasImposterVideo` booleans. URLs reach clients only through the per-socket `game:assigned` emit. Any new broadcast, event payload, or API response touching room settings must preserve this — leaking a URL breaks the game silently, not loudly.

Roles are covered by the same rule: `game:assigned` carries **only** `videoUrl`. `GameAssignment` deliberately has no `isImposter` field — a client that knows its role can read it from devtools, which defeats the mechanic. Roles first appear in the `game:results` payload, after voting closes. Don't add a role flag to any earlier payload.

**Phase machine** — `lobby → playing → words → deliberation → results`, back to `lobby`. Names match the spec's vocabulary (sections 6–8). The server owns `room.phase`; `src/hooks/useRoom.ts` mirrors it into React state, and `src/app/room/[code]/page.tsx` switches between `LobbyScreen` / `GameScreen` / `WordsScreen` / `DeliberationScreen` / `ResultsScreen`. Transitions:
- `playing → words`: **Ready Check** (section 6). Every player reports their own `game:videoEnded`, then clicks Ready (`game:readyToAdvance`). Advances when all are ready, or 10s after the *imposter's* video ends — the server starts that grace timer because it alone knows who the imposter is.
- `words → deliberation`: when the turn order is exhausted. Each turn is 10s; timing out auto-skips with a blank word.
- `deliberation → results`: when every connected player has voted, or the 90s window expires — whichever comes first.
- A **tie** does not resolve to results. `resolveVote()` returns a `revote`, and the round loops (see below).

**Timers are server-authoritative.** One `setInterval` per room in the module-level `roomTimers` Map, driven through `setRoomTimer()`/`clearRoomTimer()`. Phases are sequential so a single slot suffices. **Every path that ends a phase must clear it** — disconnects, `game:backToLobby`, room deletion — or intervals tick against a dead room. Each tick re-reads the room via `getRoom()` and bails if the phase moved on, so a stale timer cannot corrupt a later phase.

**Tie-breaking (section 8)** lives in `resolveVote()` / `beginRevote()` in `gameState.ts`. On a tie, voters who backed *neither* tied candidate are the swing voters: only their ballots are cleared, and they recast restricted to the tied pair. Voters already behind a tied candidate keep their vote. If there are no swing voters at all, the whole ballot re-runs among the tied players and loops until somebody switches — the round cannot conclude on a tie. `revoteCandidates` being non-null is what marks a restricted ballot.

**Adding a socket event requires edits in three places**, and doing two of three fails silently:
1. `src/server/socketHandlers.ts` — the handler, plus any `gameState.ts` mutator it needs.
2. `src/hooks/useRoom.ts` — a listener in the `useEffect`, *and* the matching `socket.off` in the cleanup.
3. `src/hooks/useRoom.ts` — a `useCallback` in the `actions` object, which is what components call.

**Type duplication is intentional.** `src/server/gameState.ts` holds the full server-side `RoomState` (URLs, imposter IDs, votes); `src/types/index.ts` holds the sanitized `RoomPublic` the client sees. Changing a room field means touching both plus `sanitizeRoom()`.

**Video playback** — `src/components/game/VideoPlayer.tsx` handles YouTube (IFrame API, loaded once behind a global `window._ytReady` guard), Vimeo (postMessage), and MP4 (`<video>`) behind one imperative `play()`/`pause()` handle; `src/lib/videoParser.ts` picks the type. Sync works by each client emitting `game:syncReady` on load, then the server broadcasting `game:play` with a `playAt` timestamp ~1s out that clients schedule against. Players render with `pointerEvents: 'none'` and no controls. The lockdown player vars the spec asks for in §5 (`controls=0`, `disablekb=1`, `fs=0`, `modestbranding=1`, `rel=0`) are already set.

**Coins/shop are client-side only.** `src/hooks/useShop.ts` reads/writes `localStorage` (`imposter_coins`, `imposter_shop_owned`). The server computes a `coinReward` in `game:results` but nothing persists it. Guest identity is likewise localStorage (`imposter_guest_name`, `imposter_guest_avatar`).

**Auth** — NextAuth, JWT sessions, credentials (bcrypt) plus Google/Discord providers conditionally spliced in only when their env vars exist. The `jwt`/`session` callbacks thread the DB user id onto `session.user.id`, passed as the optional `userId` on `room:create`/`room:join`.

## Where the code contradicts the spec

Verified against `src/` as of this file's writing. These are bugs-against-spec, not design choices — fix toward the spec column, and don't "preserve existing behavior" here.

Phase 1 (spec §16) closed most of the original gaps. **Fixed and verified:** role secrecy, single imposter, lobby size 4–10, reward values, combined 90s deliberation window, server-authoritative vote timer, split-vote re-vote and tie-break loops, per-player Ready Check, and the `none` comms mode.

Still outstanding:

| Area | Spec (`docs/BUILD-PLAN.md`) | Code today | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| Genres | Sports, Memes, Video Games, Music, Custom (§4) | `videoCategories.ts` has memes, sports, music | 2 |
| Video config | `/content/videos.json`, bare YouTube IDs, 10–15 per genre, no-repeat per lobby session (§14) | Hardcoded full-URL pairs in a `.ts` file, 2 pairs per genre, no no-repeat | 2 |
| 2-imposter flow | Two word+vote rounds, accused removed between them (§3) | Not implemented; `imposterCount` pinned to 1 | 2 |
| Voting visibility | Host picks Public or Anonymous (§4) | Always broadcasts a live tally | 3 |
| Currency | Persistent, account-bound (§9, §11) | localStorage only (`useShop.ts`) | 3 |
| Accounts | Email / Google / **Apple**; Discord later (§11) | Email / Google / **Discord**; no Apple | 2 |
| Host controls | Manual host transfer, mid-lobby settings changes (§4) | Auto-transfer on host leave only | 2 |
| Reconnect | — | Identity is `socket.id`, so a refresh makes a new player and drops you from the round | — |
| Not built | Emoji reactions during video (§5), premium (§12), ads (§13), shop/loot boxes (§10), profanity filter (§17), report/block (§17), friends (§11), matchmaking (§16) | — | 2–4 |

The reconnect row is not in the spec but blocks several things that are (persistent currency, host transfer surviving a refresh). It needs room state keyed on something more durable than `socket.id`.

## Conventions

- Import via `@/*` → `src/*`.
- **Styling is the VHS/CRT system in `src/app/vhs.css`** — a verbatim copy of `vhs-frontend-example/styles.css`, imported first by `globals.css`. Build with its classes (`btn-brutal`, `brutal-card`, `vhs-player`, `osd-menu`, `osd-text`, `modal-card`, `brutal-input`, `view-panel`, `gartic-*`, `lobby-item-*`). Don't edit `vhs.css` — it tracks the reference; app-only additions go in the "App additions" block in `globals.css`.
  - Every route except `/shop` is ported: `page.tsx` (landing), `/dashboard` (lobby router), `/login`, `/signup`, and all five room phases. `<CrtShell>` supplies the viewport frame — pass `home` for the scrollable marketing/console layout, omit it for the in-game `.view-panel` stack.
  - The LEGACY block at the bottom of `globals.css` (`glass`, `card`, `btn-primary`, `input-field`, `grid-bg`, `neon-*`) plus the `tailwind.config.js` violet palette are the *old* look spec §21 discards. Only `/shop` still uses them. Don't extend that system, and delete the block once the shop moves.
- Server-side sanitize all user input at the handler: words stripped of whitespace and capped at 30 chars, chat at 300, `wordsPerPlayer` clamped 1–10, `imposterCount` clamped. Keep this up for new events.
- Env: `.env.example` is the template; `.env` and `.env.local` exist locally and are gitignored. `DATABASE_URL` points at SQLite (`file:./dev.db`); switching to Postgres also means editing `provider` in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- YouTube access stays on the official IFrame API — no scraping or downloading (spec §5, ToS).

## Deployment note

Vercel cannot host this — serverless functions don't hold persistent websockets. Target Railway/Render running the custom Node server. In-memory rooms also mean this can't scale past one instance without moving room state to a shared store.

## `vhs-frontend-example/`

Standalone static prototype of the VHS/CRT UI ("Tape Suspect") — plain HTML/CSS/JS on its own file server at port 9000. Committed as of `197389f`. Shares no code with `src/` and isn't part of the Next build, but it *is* the visual source of truth: `index.html` covers the in-game views, `home.html` the landing + cosmetics shop, `join-host.html` the lobby router. Read the matching section there before designing a new screen.
